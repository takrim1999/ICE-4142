T-SQL Tutorial: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples
This T-SQL tutorial is designed for both beginners and experienced developers who want to learn how to interact with Microsoft SQL Server databases. To create this comprehensive guide, we first identified existing T-SQL tutorials and the official Microsoft documentation. Then, we compiled a list of common T-SQL commands and concepts, creating clear examples for each. Finally, we organized the tutorial into logical sections, starting with basic concepts and progressing to more advanced topics.
T-SQL (Transact-SQL) is Microsoft's proprietary extension to the SQL (Structured Query Language) used for managing and manipulating data in SQL Server databases. This tutorial will cover a wide range of T-SQL commands and concepts, from basic data retrieval to more advanced topics like stored procedures, triggers, and dynamic SQL. Each concept is explained with clear and concise examples to help you understand and apply T-SQL effectively.
Basic Concepts
Data Retrieval with SELECT
The SELECT statement is the foundation of data retrieval in SQL. It allows you to retrieve specific data from one or more tables in a database.
Syntax:


SQL




SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Example:


SQL




SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID = 10;

This query retrieves the FirstName and LastName of all employees in the Employees table who belong to department number 10.
Data Modification with INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
T-SQL provides commands for modifying data within database tables.
* INSERT: Adds new data into a table.
Syntax:


SQL




INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);

Example:


SQL




INSERT INTO Products (ProductName, Price)
VALUES ('Laptop', 1200);

This statement inserts a new product named "Laptop" with a price of 1200 into the Products table.
* UPDATE: Modifies existing data in a table.
Syntax:


SQL




UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

Example:


SQL




UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = 60000
WHERE EmployeeID = 1;

This command updates the salary of the employee with EmployeeID 1 to 60000.
* DELETE: Removes data from a table.
Syntax:


SQL




DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Example:


SQL




DELETE FROM Orders
WHERE OrderID = 101;

This query deletes the order with OrderID 101 from the Orders table.
Defining Tables with CREATE TABLE and Removing Them with DROP TABLE
* CREATE TABLE: Creates a new table in the database.
Syntax:


SQL




CREATE TABLE table_name (
   column1 datatype,
   column2 datatype,
   ...
);

Example:


SQL




CREATE TABLE Customers (
   CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
   FirstName VARCHAR(50),
   LastName VARCHAR(50),
   City VARCHAR(50)
);

This code creates a new table named Customers with columns for CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, and City.
* DROP TABLE: Removes a table from the database.
Syntax:


SQL




DROP TABLE table_name;

Example:


SQL




DROP TABLE Customers;

This statement deletes the Customers table.
Data Types
T-SQL offers a variety of data types to store different kinds of information in your database tables. These data types are categorized into several groups: 1
* String Data Types: Used to store textual data. Examples include CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT, NCHAR, NVARCHAR, and NTEXT.
* Numeric Data Types: Used for storing numbers. Examples include INT, BIGINT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, DECIMAL, NUMERIC, FLOAT, and REAL.
* Date and Time Data Types: Used for storing dates and times. Examples include DATE, TIME, DATETIME, DATETIME2, SMALLDATETIME, and DATETIMEOFFSET.
* Binary Data Types: Used to store binary data such as images or documents. Examples include BINARY, VARBINARY, and IMAGE.
* Other Data Types: T-SQL also includes other specialized data types like UNIQUEIDENTIFIER, XML, CURSOR, and TABLE.
Advanced Concepts
Stored Procedures
Stored procedures are pre-compiled groups of T-SQL statements stored in the database. They can accept input parameters and return output values, making them efficient for repetitive tasks2. For example, imagine an online store that needs to process thousands of orders daily. A stored procedure can be created to automate the order processing steps, such as updating inventory, calculating taxes, and generating invoices. This improves efficiency and reduces code duplication.
Example:


SQL




CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeesByDepartment
   @DepartmentID INT
AS
BEGIN
   SELECT EmployeeName
   FROM Employees
   WHERE DepartmentID = @DepartmentID;
END;

This stored procedure, named GetEmployeesByDepartment, takes a DepartmentID as input and returns the names of employees in that department. To execute it:


SQL




EXEC GetEmployeesInDepartment @DepartmentID = 101;

Triggers
Triggers are special stored procedures that automatically execute when a specific event occurs in the database. These events can include data modification events (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) on a table, data definition language (DDL) events like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP, and logon events3. For instance, a trigger can be used to automatically update a timestamp field whenever a row in a table is modified, ensuring data integrity and providing an audit trail.
Example:


SQL




CREATE TRIGGER trgEmployeeUpdate
ON dbo.Employee
AFTER UPDATE
AS
INSERT INTO dbo.EmpLog(EmpID, Operation, UpdatedDate)
SELECT EmployeeID, 'UPDATE', GETDATE()
FROM DELETED;

This trigger, trgEmployeeUpdate, inserts a log entry into the EmpLog table whenever an employee record is updated in the Employee table.
Functions
Functions are routines that accept input parameters and return a single value or a result set4. T-SQL supports different types of functions: 1
* Scalar Functions: These functions take one or more parameters and return a single value. For example, a function to calculate the discount price of a product.
* Aggregate Functions: These functions operate on a set of values and return a single value. Common examples include SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, and MAX.
* Table-Valued Functions: These functions return a table as a result set. They can be used in place of a table in a FROM clause.
Example:


SQL




CREATE FUNCTION dbo.CalculateAge (@BirthDate DATE)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
   DECLARE @Age INT;
   SELECT @Age = DATEDIFF(year, @BirthDate, GETDATE());
   RETURN @Age;
END;

This function, CalculateAge, calculates the age of a person based on their birth date.
Views
Views are virtual tables based on the result set of a SQL statement. They provide a customized view of the data without storing it separately5. For example, a company might have a large Employees table with sensitive information like salaries. A view can be created to show only the employee names and departments, restricting access to confidential data.
Example:


SQL




CREATE VIEW ActiveCustomers AS
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Customers
WHERE Active = 1;

This view, ActiveCustomers, shows only the active customers from the Customers table.
Cursors
Cursors allow you to process data in a result set one row at a time6. While cursors offer flexibility, they can have a significant performance overhead compared to set-based operations7. Therefore, it's generally recommended to use set-based approaches whenever possible and reserve cursors for situations where row-by-row processing is essential.
Example:


SQL




DECLARE @CustomerID INT;
DECLARE customer_cursor CURSOR FOR
SELECT CustomerID FROM Customers;

OPEN customer_cursor;

FETCH NEXT FROM customer_cursor INTO @CustomerID;

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
   -- Perform actions with @CustomerID
   FETCH NEXT FROM customer_cursor INTO @CustomerID;
END;

CLOSE customer_cursor;
DEALLOCATE customer_cursor;

This code iterates through each CustomerID in the Customers table using a cursor.
Dynamic SQL
Dynamic SQL allows you to construct and execute SQL statements at runtime8. This can be useful for building flexible queries where the table or column names are not known in advance. However, it's crucial to use parameterized dynamic SQL to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities9. Parameterized queries help protect your database from malicious attacks by treating user inputs as data rather than executable code.
Example:


SQL




DECLARE @sql nvarchar(max);
DECLARE @TableName nvarchar(50);
SET @TableName = 'Customers';
SET @sql = N'SELECT * FROM ' + QUOTENAME(@TableName);
EXEC sp_executesql @sql;

This code dynamically builds a SELECT statement to retrieve data from the table specified in the @TableName variable.
Transactions
Transactions ensure that a set of database operations are treated as a single unit of work. All operations within a transaction either succeed or fail together10. This is essential for maintaining data consistency and integrity, especially in scenarios involving multiple related operations. For example, when transferring money between bank accounts, a transaction ensures that both the debit and credit operations are completed successfully or both are rolled back in case of an error.
Example:


SQL




BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountID = 2;
COMMIT TRANSACTION;

This code transfers 100 from account 1 to account 2 within a transaction. If either UPDATE statement fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
Error Handling
T-SQL provides TRY...CATCH blocks for handling errors in your code11. This allows you to gracefully handle unexpected situations and prevent your application from crashing. Within the CATCH block, you can log the error, display a user-friendly message, or attempt to recover from the error.
Example:


SQL




BEGIN TRY
   -- Code that might cause an error
   SELECT 1/0;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
   SELECT 
       ERROR_NUMBER() AS ErrorNumber,
       ERROR_MESSAGE() AS ErrorMessage;
END CATCH;

This code catches the divide-by-zero error and displays the error number and message.
